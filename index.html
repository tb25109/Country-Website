        <p>
            Iceland is a beautiul country located in the middle of the Atlantic ocean, off the coast of Greenland. As far as languages go, most Icelanders speak fluent English, as well as some speaking German, Danish, and French, so the place is a relatively good tourist spot for people alike. Icelands economy has mostly historically relied on smelting aluminum and fishing.
