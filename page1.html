            Why is Iceland called iceland if it is green?
        </h1>

        <p>
            Iceland was originally found by vikings that wanted a place to reside, around the same time of that voyage, they also found Greenland. Interestingly enough, the vikings didn't want people visiting their island, so they named Greenland as it would sound pleasant while also being much more unpredictable. The psycology behind it was, if they named greenland that, people would not want to go to Iceland because they would think "Oh, if Greenland is this icy and its the green part, Iceland will be way worse!" and it worked, because they managed to reside in Iceland with virtually no disturbances.
